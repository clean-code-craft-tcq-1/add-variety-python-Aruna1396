# Check and Alert based on types

This exercise is based on the [BMS monitoring] domain.

Expand the checks and alerts to take care of a variety of types.

## Open for Extensions

How can you minimize the amount of work done to add a new type?
Can you add without modifying existing code?


## Notes for the exercise:

Implemented strategy pattern for openness because of which we are able to add "printing to console" feature with very minimal modifications.
Eliminating if else loops with dictionaries allows flexible extensions.
